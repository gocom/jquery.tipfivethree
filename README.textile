h1. jquery.tipFiveThree

p. CSS3 powered jQuery tooltips plugin. This ain't stable yet. While this is a real plugin sitting on top of functional codebase, it was originally sparked from the idea and want to test "Bower":https://github.com/twitter/bower. It's quick old script of mine. It used to use normal JavaScript based animations, but to spice things up I changed them to just all CSS. Thus the name and slogan. And, yes they are buggy. Slowdowns, blocking and especially all sorts of text and shadow rendering issues. Totally wort it.

p. I wouldn't use this for anything production, not in the state it is now. Let's see how well I can get this thing polished up. Anyhow, let's get the standard install instructions thing over next.

h2. Installing

Using "Bower":https://github.com/twitter/bower:

bc. $ bower install jquery.tipFiveThree

Yes, it's case-sensitive.

h2. Basic usage

p. Importing sources the old way:

bc. <link rel="stylesheet" href="components/jquery.tipFiveThree/jquery.tipfivethree.css" />
<script src="components/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="components/jquery.tipFiveThree/jquery.tipfivethree.js"></script>

p. Initializing on-hover tooltips:
